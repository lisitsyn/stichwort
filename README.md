*This library is deprecated*

Stichwort is a simple tool for C++ keyword arguments. The library provides rather
clean and simple API for creating keywords and handling them as function parameters.
For example with predefined keywords `port` (as a static instance of the 
`stichwort::ParameterKeyword<unsigned int>` class) and `address` 
(as a static instance of the `stichwort::ParameterKeyword<std::string>` class) 
you may use the following syntax:

	spawn_server(handler,stichwort::kwargs[port=80,address="127.0.0.1"]);

Or even (if your compiler supports C++11):

	spawn_server(handler,{port=80,address="127.0.0.1"});

In case of any troubles with the code please don't hesitate to fire 
[an issue at github](https://github.com/lisitsyn/stichwort/issues/new).

This project uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/lisitsyn/stichwort).
